# Contribution Guide

Welcome! We're thrilled that you want to help make this project even better. We
do ask that you follow some general guidelines while doing so, just so we can
keep things organized around here.

1. Make sure an [issue][1] is created for the bug you're about to fix, or
   feature you're about to add. Keep them as small as possible.

2. We use a forking, feature-based workflow.

   Make a fork of this repository, and create a branch based on `master` named
   specifically for the feature/bugfix on which you'd like to work. Make your
   changes there. Commit often.

3. Squash commits into one, well-formatted commit. Mention the issue being
   resolved in the commit message on a line all by itself like `Fixes #<bug>`
   (refer to [linking a pull request to an issue][2] for more keywords you can
   use).

   If you really feel like there should be more than one commit in your branch,
   then you're probably trying to introduce more than one feature and you should
   make another branch (and issue) for it.

4. Submit a pull request to get changes from your branch into `master`. Mention
   which bug is being resolved in the description. Remember: the smaller your
   pull request, the faster it will be reviewed, and the more likely it is to
   be accepted.
